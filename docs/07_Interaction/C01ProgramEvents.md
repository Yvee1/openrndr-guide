    An OPENRNDR program can listen to events generated by the program itself.

    ### Program ended event
11
    This event is generated when the program draw loop has ended. 
 
 ```kotlin
application {
    program {
        ended.listen {
            println("the program has ended")
        }
    }
}
```
